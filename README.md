# flipkart_scraping_iphone_python
This is a small web app that will let you gather all the information related to the the latest iphones in the market.
User will be asked to enter the number of webpages he want to scrape. 
I have also used time.sleep() function in order to let the user see the details one by one on console.
Also , the final results will be stored in csv file.
